Recently, I've been playing with PyTorch while following through the amazing Daniel Bourke's course in the matter. [A link for those interested.](https://www.learnpytorch.io) 

While I must admit I didn't get further than chapter 3 before being slogged down with an unruly amount of university assignments, the course brought to attention an important feature of many graphing softwares which physicists really seem to take for granted; fitting a linear regression line. 

While it is an objectively simple problem,
