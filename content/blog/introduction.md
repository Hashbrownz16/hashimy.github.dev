Hi, I'm Hashim! I'm a recent Physics graduate from the University of Warwick with an interest in voice synthesis, materials science and vocaloid.

This website is intended to be a log of my personal projects, sorta as a "this is the thought process I went through when doing this" kind of thing. If you think any of the articles on here could benefit from more graphics, more explanation or just want to have a chat, feel free to contact me at hashimuyasin@gmail.com or send me a whatsapp! Alternatively, my discord is "geemgeem" for those of you who'd prefer something a little less formal. 

Have a great day, and thank you for reading!
