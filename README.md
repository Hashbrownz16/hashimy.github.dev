# hashimy.github.io

A moderately modified website built on Hugo. 

Modified and improved version of NPQHugo: https://github.com/saadjsct/npqhugo 

**Changes:**

- MathJax support added
- Updated to properly compile after certain parts of code made redundant
- Grammar and small presentation improvements
- Colour scheme personalised for my own use
- Config file changed to adapt to GitHub Pages, formerly outdated
- Added comments in areas I didn't know what was happening because I'm not very good at this stuff yet
- Very useful example site removed (thank you previous author, it was a good idea)
